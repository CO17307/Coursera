     <p>Hi there! to anyone reading this have a good day.Here is a quote for u, “I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.”
    ― Marilyn Monroe.</p>
    <p>“You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,
    Love like you'll never be hurt,
    Sing like there's nobody listening,
    And live like it's heaven on earth.”
    ― William W. Purkey</p>
    <p>“Don’t walk in front of me… I may not follow
    Don’t walk behind me… I may not lead
    Walk beside me… just be my friend”
    ― Albert Camus

      <p>"Steady Ed" Headrick invented the frisbee in the 1950s, then went on to create the sport of disc golf in the 1970s. "He lived for frisbee," his wife said of the inventor of the classic American toy. When he died in 2002, his final wish was to have his ashes turned into, what else, but a frisbee. His son said it was his father's dream that they play with him after death and that he might even accidentally end up on someone's roof.</p>

      <p>One night four college students were out partying late night and didn’t study for the test which was scheduled for the next day. In the morning, they thought of a plan.They made themselves look dirty with grease and dirt. Then they went to the Dean and said they had gone out to a wedding last night and on their way back the tire of their car burst and they had to push the car all the way back. So they were in no condition to take the test. The Dean thought for a minute and said they can have the re-test after 3 days. They thanked him and said they will be ready by that time. On the third day, they appeared before the Dean. The Dean said that as this was a Special Condition Test, all four were required to sit in separate classrooms for the test. They all agreed as they had prepared well in the last 3 days.
    The Test consisted of only 2 questions with the total of 100 Points:
    1) Your Name? __________ (1 Points)
    2) Which tire burst? __________ (99 Points)
    Options – (a) Front Left (b) Front Right (c) Back Left (d) Back Right
    <p>Moral of the story:</p>
     Take responsibility or you will learn your lesson.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
